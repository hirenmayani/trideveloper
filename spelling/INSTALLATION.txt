To install the servlet, copy the spelling dictionary file ("spellcheck.txt",
found in the same directory as these directions) alongside the
TRIRIGA configuration properties (found in the "config" subdirectory of your
TRIRIGA installation).  Then deploy the "spelling.war" warfile.  Under JBoss,
this can be done by copying the warfile to the "server/all/deploy"
subdirectory under the JBoss root; similar steps would be taken for other
application servers (consult your documentation).

After deploying, you should be able to point your web browser at
"/spelling/index.html" on your app server and see a small test page.

To add the spell checking functionality to your GUIs:


1) Upload "spelling.html" (found in the same directory as these instructions)
   into Document Manager.  You only need to perform this step once.

2) Revise your GUI.

3) Add a new Report Section at the very bottom of the tab, specifying the
   "spelling.html" file as the source Document.  Make sure the section is
   set to Visible, but hide the title bar and set the height to "1".

4) Publish your GUI.


Once added, you should be able to press "F7" when editing a field to spell
check that field, and "Shift-F7" to check all fields on the tab.
