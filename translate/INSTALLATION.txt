To install the translation custom workflow task, copy the "translate.jar"
jarfile to the "server/all/lib" subdirectory under the JBoss root (typically
found directly under the TRIRIGA installation root).  After installing you
will need to restart JBoss.

For other application server platforms, consult your server documentation.

The "translate-om.zip" Object Migration package can then be imported, which
will create a "devTranslationHelper" object under the triHelper module.

To perform translations, create a devTranslationHelper instance and specify
the field name (and optionally the section name) that will be translated on
the target object.  The target language must also be specified (default is
"en", English).  The source language can optionally be specified; if left
blank, the source language will be auto-detected.

Once the helper object is configured, create an "Alters" association from
the helper object to the target objects that are to be translated.  To
perform the translation, simply trigger the "triApply" action
on the helper object.  The "Alters" associations will be removed after
translation has completed; to delete the helper object, simply trigger
the "triDelete" action on the object.
